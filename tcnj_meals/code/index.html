                        <h1>Food Insecurity Aricle</h1>
                        <p>Food insecurity, which is not having reliable, available quantities of food,  is apparent in TCNJ, even though many students may not visibly see it. In April of 2018, Heather Haase, Web Editor of TCNJ Signal, wrote an article surrounding the food insecurity issue TCNJ students struggle with. She noted a survey conducted by another university in which more than a third of college students have been food insecure within the past 30 days. As students, your close friends may not know where their next meal will come from, and you may not even have a clue. As professors, your students’ greatest concerns sometimes are not about their grades, but rather about survival. Although there are meal plans at TCNJ, they cost thousands of dollars a year to have, which is not a viable option for every student. Thus, there is a need for resources that aid students who do not have enough money for food. TCNJ Meals Food Bank serves to lessen the food insecurity at TCNJ.</p>
